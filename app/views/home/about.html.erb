Think of a cryptocurrency portfolio as a businessâ€™s profit and loss statement. Cryptocurrency investors can use their portfolios to take stock of their assets, ensuring they grow over time. As such, a cryptocurrency portfolio enables investors to keep an eye out on their inventory, so to speak, so nothing gets wasted. If an investment is causing a significant loss, the constant monitoring would warn the investor about it. If, on the other hand, a coin is making tons of money, the investor can invest more in it.</p>
